# Data_structure_randomness
This repository implements a system for generating random Binary Search Trees (BSTs) in C++ and analyzing their structure by visualizing them using Graphviz DOT format. The project focuses on studying each randomly generated BST, providing insight into their properties through graphical representation.

How It Works:
1. Random Tree Generation: A BST is randomly generated by inserting random nodes while maintaining the binary search tree properties.
2. DOT File Creation: The tree is traversed, and its relationships are written to a DOT file for visualization.
3. Graph Rendering: The DOT file can be used with Graphviz to produce a visual graph that displays the structure of the random BST.
4. Tree Analysis: Each generated BST can be analyzed based on key structural properties like height, node depth, and balance, making it useful for studying tree behavior in different scenarios.
